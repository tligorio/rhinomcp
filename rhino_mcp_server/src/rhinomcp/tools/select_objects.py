    """
    Select objects in the Rhino document.
    
    Parameters:
    - filters: A dictionary containing the filters. The filters parameter is necessary, unless it's empty, in which case all objects will be selected.
    - filters_type: The type of the filters, it's "and" or "or", default is "and"

    Note:
    The filter value is always a list, even if it's a single value. The reason is that a filter can contain multiple values, for example when we query by a attribute that has EITHER value1 OR value2.

    The filters dictionary can contain the following keys:
    - name: The name of the object
    - color: The color of the object, for example [255, 0, 0]

    Additionaly, rhino allows to have user custom attributes, which can be used to filters the objects.
    For example, if the object has a user custom attribute called "category", the filters dictionary can contain:
    - category: custom_attribute_value

    Example:
    filters = {
        "name": ["object_name1", "object_name2"],
        "category": ["custom_attribute_value"]
    },
    filters_type = "or"
    

    Returns:
    A number indicating the number of objects that have been selected.
